Filling in missing values of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) 

# Objective
To understand how the ocean communicates with Earth's atmosphere it is important to know sea surface temperature. SST provides fundamental information on the global climate system. However, these SST data are often influenced by the presence of clouds in the atmosphere, malfunctions in the satellite or images noises, which can cause missing data.

In this study, a matrix factorization algorithm for determination of missing values in a spatio-temporal dataset of sea surface temperature is presented. The spatial resolution of the data set that has been used for modeling is 0.25o X 0.25o   

A sea surface temperature (SST) data from the NOAA AVHRR data is reconstructed for various percentage of missing values spread to check the algorithmâ€™s utility.
